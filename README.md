This repository contains the projects completed during my Virtual Web Development Internship at CodeSoft. The internship focused on building frontend web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with emphasis on clean UI design, responsiveness, and interactive user experiences.

The projects helped strengthen my understanding of core web development concepts and practical implementation of real-world frontend features.
